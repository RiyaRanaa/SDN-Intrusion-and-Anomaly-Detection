# SDN-Intrusion-and-Anomaly-Detection
SDN Intrusion and Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning

Description:
This project implements an intrusion and anomaly detection system for Software-Defined Networks (SDN) using machine learning techniques. SDN, being a dynamic and programmable network architecture, requires robust security mechanisms to detect and prevent potential attacks.

The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: A large dataset containing various network traffic features was imported and cleaned. The dataset includes 80 distinct features, such as packet lengths, flow durations, and header lengths, which are critical for identifying anomalies in network traffic.

Feature Engineering: The dataset was explored to understand the distribution of each feature and its relevance to detecting intrusions. The features were then prepared for input into machine learning models, including handling missing values and normalizing the data.

Model Training: Multiple machine learning models were trained to classify network traffic as either benign or malicious. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective approach for anomaly detection.

Anomaly Detection: The final model was deployed to identify anomalies in real-time network traffic. This involved classifying incoming packets and flows to detect potential intrusions, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or other malicious activities.

Evaluation and Optimization: The model's performance was continuously monitored, and further optimizations were made to enhance detection accuracy. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in securing SDN environments against evolving threats.

Technologies Used:

Python (for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation)
Pandas and NumPy (for data processing)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning model development)
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis and development)
Outcome:
The project successfully developed a machine learning-based intrusion detection system for SDN environments. The system is capable of identifying various types of network anomalies with high accuracy, providing a critical layer of security in modern networking architectures.
